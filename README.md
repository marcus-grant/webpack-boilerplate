# Webpack Boilerplate

My boilerplate repository for all my various kinds of webpack build environments. Each different kind is its own branch. So to create a new webpack app/server, just clone this repo and run `./clean` to finish setup. Eventually this will hopefully become a node script with a prompt to select options instead.
